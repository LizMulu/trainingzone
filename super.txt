GIT NOTES
The command we are using so far is git config
git config –global user .name “Liz Mulu”
git config –global user .email mululiz106@gmail.com
git config –global init.default branch main

But to find other commands that you can use you can type:
git config -h
git help config ; manual page for what different commands do

To clear all that in your command window you type:
clear

You now want to use git to track your files: cd (change directory)
cd C:\Users\SAMUEL\Documents\training zone

To turn the above into a git repository:
git  init C:\Users\SAMUEL\Documents\training zone

We have now created our first repository.
To check the status:
git status
